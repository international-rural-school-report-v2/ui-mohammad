        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>
          Our team is made up of a group of driven, creative and self-motivated
          engineers from different places around the world. Our team consists of
          Lambda School students that are still going through the program as
          students, and we believe that we can demonstrate our ability through
          programming for good, which is why we have chosen this project. As
          programmers, we have the ability to create anything, so why not build
          applications that help our children and our communities? We hope that
          IRSR does just that!
